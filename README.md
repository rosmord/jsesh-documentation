# JSesh documentation web site

The old JSesh documentation site used dokuwiki, which is a very nice piece of software, but is not very easy to maintain.


I have decided to move most of my code to [grav](https://getgrav.org/), which I feel will be easier for me to work with (it has fewer security issues as I won't have editing features).

I will first "translate" all the existing JSesh documentation pages to markdown, and put the source for this documentation on github.

## Helping with the documentation

The JSesh documentation uses relatively simple files, in the [`markdown`](https://learn.getgrav.org/17/content/markdown) format.

To write a translation of the documentation, you need to create `.md` files, as is done for instance in the folder  `www/user/pages/040.editing/010.mouse`, which is the part of the documentation related to the mouse use:

| file name       | use                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| docs.es.md      | spanish version of the page   |
| docs.fr.md      | french version                |
| docs.md         | default (english) version     |
| groupEditor.png | a picture used by those pages |
| Hm_kA.png       | a picture used by those pages |
| mr_xAswt.png    | a picture used by those pages |
| palette_en.png  | a picture used by those pages |
| stp_n_ra1.png   | a picture used by those pages |
| stp_n_ra2.png   | a picture used by those pages |
| w_and_t.png     | a picture used by those pages |


`.es` and `.fr` are codes for the language used. You can find them in the [description of ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).


If we look at `docs.md`, we see 

~~~markdown
---
title: Mouse Editing // the title of the page, which should be translated
author:... if you translate, you can put your name here...
taxonomy:
    category: docs
---

...

Editing with the mouse is a simple but slow process. Typically, it is combined with other editing methods.

Markdown is fairly straightforward. You can use the existing documentation as a guideline. In general, if you are translating the documentation, you will use the same structure as the existing documentation, so you can:

- copy the file you want to translate, adding the correct language code to it :
  ~~~
    cp docs.md docs.fr.md
  ~~~

- edit your new file, replacing the original text with its translation.

You might want to translate some of the pictures. It's quite easy. Simple create a new picture with the translated content.

Then in the markdown file, replace the name of the original picture with the translated one.


## Markdown enhancement for this site

This site allows you to :

- add captions to pictures like this:
  ~~~markdown
  ![](./tagEditor.png?classes=caption "The Tag Creation Window")
  ~~~

  You need to add `?classes=caption` after the picture name, then the caption itself, between quotes.

- use inline pictures. Normally, pictures will occur on a line of their own. If you want them to be part of the text, use `classes=inline` : 

  ~~~markdown
  ![](./importSigns3.png?classes=inline)
  ~~~

- use a simplified version of the *Manuel de Codage* to quote hieroglyphic texts. You need to write a `<span>` with class `mdc`:

  ~~~markdown
  It can be understood as a ligature between the sign <span class="mdc">F20</span> and the group <span class="mdc">xAst:xAst:xAst</span>.
  ~~~

Note that `*` has a special meaning for markdown, and that you might need to put a `\` in front of them:

~~~markdown
 <span class='mdc'>p\*t:pt</span>
~~~


## Where are the files ?

All the files you might need to edit or copy are in `www/user/pages`.

Some of them are called `chapter.md`, and others `docs.md`.

## Running a local copy of the documentation

If you want to provide a translation for your own language, the pages are in `user/pages`. Look for the files ending in `.md`. To translate a file, simply create, at the same place, a file with the same name, but with ending `.LANG.md`, where LANG is the code for your language. You can ask me if you want.


~~~bash
cd www
./bin/grav serve
~~~
