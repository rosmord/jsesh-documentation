====== Parts of SVG understood by JSesh ======

JSesh does not understand SVG fully. Basically, it expects the picture to be made of a filled black path. All constructs in a path are understood, but I suggest to use lines and splines mainly.

A bit more of the language is covered, but there are things it doesn't understand yet, in particular transforms.
