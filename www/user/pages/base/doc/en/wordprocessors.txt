====== JSesh and Word processors ======

A detailled chapter is devoted to how to use JSesh with various word processors. Here I will only make a small list, and give suggestions.

  * **MS WORD** : your mileage may vary! This is not Microsoft bashing, it's a simple constatation. JSesh exports its hieroglyphs as pictures, and word doesn't like them very much. To be honest, it depends on the version of Word. Recently (as of 2016), I had the pleasant surprise to see that RTF+EMF was now correctly handled by Word 2011 on the Mac. However, I have had many problems with Mac OS versions of Word. Word 2008 tended to mix the pictures. Signs would appear in unexpected parts of the document. Later versions of Word on the Mac seem to have dropped Microsoft's own versions of its own format. In the latest versions of Word, the picture formats supported by the Mac OS and Windows versions of Word **are not the same**. Which means the files are not portable. A random quote from an angry user on http://www.officeformachelp.com/ : "//It is true that Microsoft seems generally to be against anything that would make printing documents on win & mac compatible. In addition to this problem, on Win you must use .emf for vector graphics, while on Mac, pdf. Its only the 11th version of Office.//"
  * LibreOffice, OpenOffice and Neooffice are good, and provide a reasonable compatibility with Word. They respect the pictures you give them, and don't modify them. LibreOffice has a nicer screen display. To be honest, I like the Word processing part, but the "slide" presentation system (Impress) is not really good. OpenOffice (and co) have the really nice advantage that everyone can have the same version of the software.
  * Mac-Specific softwares like Mellel give good results, but have a hard time exporting their text to the rest of the world, especially when the said text contains pictures. So it depends on what you want to do with your texts.
