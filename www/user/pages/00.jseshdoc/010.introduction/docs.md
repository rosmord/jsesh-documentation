You are currently using JSesh, which is both an editor for hieroglyphic texts and a toolset for manipulating hieroglyphic texts in Java. As a user, you are probably more interested in JSesh editing and printing capabilities.

JSesh covers most of the Manuel de Codage and can read files coming from a number of other softwares, as Winglyph and Tksesh. Macscribe compatibility has not been tested, and is probably not full.

The [manuel de codage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_de_Codage) is a standard which was created in 1984 for describing hieroglyphic texts in ASCII. It's a bit old by now, and there are various suggestions to improve it (or replace it). JSesh will propose a number of extensions. JSesh also allows you to edit hieroglyphic texts, either by typing manuel de codage codes, or by a more intuitive menu system. Some manuel de codage features are not available yet through the menus, but you have always the possibility of writing the code directly.

JSesh has a number of output capabilities. It can print a file, or save it in various interesting graphic formats : pdf, jpg, or even as set of html files. Among the possible outputs, one must note the WMF (windows metafiles output). Metafiles are vector images, which means they are well suited for printing. WMF files can be read by almost all word processors.

JSesh, contrarily to tksesh, is not primarily a text database. The text database capabilities of tksesh will be added to JSesh in the future, but I thought it would be better to provide a nice editor/displayer first, in order to involve people.
