### Chapter 1

Currently, [Jsesh documentation](http://jseshdoc.qenherkhopeshef.org/) uses a dokuwiki server, but I'd like to unify most of my web sites with something easier to maintain (basically, without users).

Thus, I'm moving to [grav](https://getgrav.org/), and the sources for the documentation will be hosted on github.

Meanwhile : this web site is a work in progress (currently, it's basically an empty shell). The true documentation is [here](http://jseshdoc.qenherkhopeshef.org/).
