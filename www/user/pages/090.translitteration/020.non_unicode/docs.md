**I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU USE UNICODE** (Sorry for shouting, but it's important).

You can select a font with a MdC-compatible encoding. In this case, JSesh does not deal with capital letters. You can choose your own font, if you have one, or use the default JSesh transliteration font. A version of this font is embedded in the software, but you can install it on your system (to use with a word processor, for instance). A copy of this font is available in the font folder of JSesh installation.

## Easy way with the old font

You should open the "Preferences" menu (on the Mac, it's in the "JSesh" menu; elsewhere, it's under the "Edit Menu"). Go to the "Font Preferences" Tab, and click the "use old transliteration font" button.

That's it. For your own Word (or OpenOffice...) documents, you can find the font in the JSesh application folder (in the "font" folder).

## Using your own MdC-compatible fonts

If you have a font compatible with the MdC (that is, the "a" represents an ayn, the "A" represents an aleph, etc...), you can use it too.

Simply select your font (using "Choose font" in front of the Transliteration font), and then, in the advanced options, select "MdC (non Unicode) Transliteration font".
