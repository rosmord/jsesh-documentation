With a font comprising around 7,000 signs, occasional errors are, unfortunately, inevitable. For various reasons—legal among them—the font included with JSesh cannot simply reproduce the Winglyph or Macscribe fonts.

In some cases, the differences between JSesh signs and the forms presented in Hieroglyphica[^1] may be purely stylistic. However, in more serious instances, notable details may differ — for example, the shape of a beard, or the presence or absence of an uraeus on a sign representing a deity. The most problematic cases occur when the signs are fundamentally dissimilar. This typically happens when an incorrect code was assigned to a sign in JSesh.

The straightforward solution would be to rename the sign in JSesh and move on. However, as JSesh has now been in use for over twenty years, altering sign codes risks breaking a considerable number of existing texts. For this reason, we have adopted the following approach:

- all changes to sign forms between JSesh versions are documented on the  [JSesh website](https://jsesh.qenherkhopeshef.org/signdiffs);

- when we decide to retain the JSesh version of a sign — which means it will differ from that in Hieroglyphica - we document the discrepancy in the present appendix of JSesh documentation.
