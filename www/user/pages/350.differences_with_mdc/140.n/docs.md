![](N104.png?classes=inline) **N104**
: JSesh uses this shape instead of the *Hieroglyphica* shape ![](N104B.png?classes=inline). As it's a rather common shape, it's used in many texts, and reverting to the Hieroglyphica encoding would break too many things.

![](N104B.png?classes=inline) **N104B**
: this code, which is specific to JSesh, stands sign originally coded as N104 in the Hieroglyphica.
