This is the JSesh user documentation. It will available in a number of languages :

- [Spanish](/../es)
- [English](/../en)
- [French](/../fr)

Other versions are available as external ressources, notably a Japanese version.

Feel free to contact me to add other translations, I can guide you.

The current structure of the documentation is likely to change a bit. The current version is mostly a copy of the original version to a new web site.
