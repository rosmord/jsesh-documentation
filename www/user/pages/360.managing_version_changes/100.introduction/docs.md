The rythm of JSesh update is currently rather slow. But every two years or so, a new version of JSesh is published. It provides new functionalities, bug fixes, new texts, and new or modified hieroglyphic signs.

It is usually a good thing. Most people rejoice in Thebes, and make a great burnt offering to Amun-Rê when a new version of JSesh is published. But... other are less happy. In particular, when you are in the middle of the writing of your PHD, and that, all of a sudden, the shape of the G1 <span class='mdc'>G1</span> glyph is modified in all the new texts you write.

Should you refrain from installing new versions? How can you concile having the latest, shining new version of JSesh and keeping your past work intact?

This chapter is for you. We will deal first with the main real problem: *changes in the fonts.*
