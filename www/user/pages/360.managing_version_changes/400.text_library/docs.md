JSesh includes a text library in a folder called `texts`. It's included in the JSesh software distribution, which means that the folder related to version *n*  will be deleted when you uninstall this version. 

I **strongly** suggest that, if you want to work on a text, you **copy** the file somewhere else, in your document folder for instance.

Note that the texts have now their own folder on github: [MDC-texts](https://github.com/rosmord/MDC-texts).
